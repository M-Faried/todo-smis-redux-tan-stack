# 📐 SMIS Transition From Redux To TanStack/React Query

This project is to show SMIS design pattern in action. SMIS design pattern is a patter to abstract the state manager of your application and ease the transition from one state manager to another with the minimum amount of code updates.

👉 You can find the full explanation of SMIS Design Pattern in this article: [SMIS Design Pattern](https://medium.com/@m.a.faried/smis-design-pattern-d725a7ad814c)

👉 Also, you can find explaining the purpose of this project in this article [SMIS DP In Action]()

## 🚀 Running The Application
* If it is not already installed on your machine, you need to install json-server package using "npm i json-server -g"
* Open a terminal window and cd into json-server folder.
* Run the command "npm run start" to start the json.
* To run the application with only Redux or the one with Redux and react-query, open a new terminal and cd into one of the folders accordingly.
* Run the command "npm run start".

## 🔬 Switching Between Redux & React Query

If you are in the final project "todos-react-query-redux" and want to switch between the two state managers, open the file in the path "todos-react-query-redux\src\appState\config.js" and change the value of TodosStateManagerConfig to either of the 2 state managers.
